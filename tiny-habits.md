## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### Question 2

1- Understanding the formula for behavior—behavior = motivation + ability + prompt—is essential for creating new habits.<br>
2- Create little, quick habits to start with so that you need less prodding to carry them out.<br>
3- External or internal prompts are less effective than action prompts that are activated by the accomplishment of one behaviour.<br>
4- When you achieve a small victory, celebrate it by giving your habit some "shine" to help you feel inspired and motivated.<br>
5- Flexibility to do more or go back to the smallest version is essential for maintaining a habit. Small habits are effective and enduring.


### Question 3


#### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

"Shining" or celebrating after each successful completion of a habit is crucial because it reinforces positive behavior and provides several benefits that are essential for habit formation.
1- Motivation and Confidence <br>
2- Emotional Connection:<br>
3- Consistency and Habit Integration<br>
4- Positive Reinforcemen

### Question 4
####  what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Dave Brailsford's "1% better" philosophy drove British Cycling's success through small improvements. Small habits have a compounding effect: 1% daily improvement leads to significant success, while decline results in failure. Your environment shapes behavior, so design it for good habits. Consistency is key, start with the "two-minute rule." Immediate rewards maintain habits; use the "Seinfeld strategy" to enjoy the journey.

### Question 5
#### What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book's perspective on identity is that it plays a crucial role in habit change and personal development. It emphasizes that to build lasting habits, it's essential to see yourself as the type of person who embodies those habits. In other words, your self-identity and self-image are powerful determinants of your behavior. When you identify as someone who does a particular habit, you are more likely to consistently act in alignment with that identity. This perspective underscores the idea that lasting habit change goes beyond setting goals and instead involves a shift in how you perceive yourself and your daily actions. By adopting a new identity related to the habits you want to establish, you are more likely to make those habits a permanent part of your life.

### Question 6
#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book offers several insights into making a habit easier to do, emphasizing the importance of simplifying the process to reduce resistance and friction. Here are some key points from the book regarding how to make a habit easier to adopt:

1- Start with Small <br>
2- The Two-Minute Rule<br>
3- Make Consistency<br>
4- Behavioral Science Principles

### Question 7

#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
The book primarily focuses on making habits easier to do, as it emphasizes positive behavior change and the benefits of simplifying the process. However, it indirectly suggests some strategies for making a habit harder to do when you're trying to break a negative habit or eliminate an unwanted behavior. Here are some insights that can be derived from the book's perspective on making habits harder to do:

1- Change your environment<br>
2- Share your goals with friends or family <br>
3- Time and Energy Managemen<br>
4- Mindfulness and Self-Awareness

### Question 8:
#### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I choose the habit of "consistency" as the one I'd like to do more of. Consistency is a fundamental aspect of achieving  goals and maintaining positive habits. To make the habit of consistency more attractive, easy, and satisfying, I can consider the following steps:

1- Define specific goals that I want to be consistent with.<br>
2- Break down my larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks<br>
3- Establish a daily or weekly routine for my tasks. 
4- treat myself with a small reward when I consistently complete a week's worth of tasks or achieve a milestone.
5- Stay Positive

### Question 9:
### What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

 I consider the habit of "excessive social media usage" as the one to eliminate or reduce. To make the cue invisible, the process unattractive, the response unsatisfying, and ultimately reduce social media usage, I can take the following steps:

1- Working on my passion <br>
2- Replace with Productive Habits<br>
3- Engage in hobbies, exercise, or read a book<br>
4- Set Time Limits of social media
5- Keep a record of my daily social media usage
