# Grit and Growth Mindset

## 1. Grit

#### Question 1

Success in school and in life isn't solely determined by IQ; drive and tenacity also key.
 Grit is a powerful predictor of success in a variety of circumstances. Grit is described as desire and tenacity for long-term goals.
 Even when matched for other qualities, kids who are more tenacious are more likely to graduate from high school.
 Grit is frequently unconnected to talent; brilliance by itself does not make someone tenacious.
More study is required to comprehend and effectively develop grit in youngsters, but a growth mindset—believing in the capacity to learn and change through effort—can help.
